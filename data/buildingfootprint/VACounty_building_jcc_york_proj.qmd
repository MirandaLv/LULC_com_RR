  <abstract>The shape and orientation of the ground floor of all structures in a local government. This information is typically compiled from orthoimagery or other aerial photography sources. This representation of the building footprints support the local government basemaps. It also serves as a source for public works, public safety, planning and other agencies that are responsible for the active management of site addresses, facilities, and land use information.

Building footprints are polygon outlines of structures remotely rendered through digitizing of Virginia Base Mapping Program’s digital ortho-photogrammetry imagery, or digitizing of local government subdivision plats. VBMP building footprints are a collection of locally submitted data and as published from the Virginia Geographic Information Network carry no addressing, nor is there any ownership, resident information, or construction specifications provided. VBMP building footprints are not assumed to be of survey quality and carry no guarantees as to accuracy. Even with these restrictions building outlines are a valuable resource for emergency response operations and for community planning. Currently the Virginia Base Mapping Program’s collection of building footprints consists of over 4 million structures. Data input from localities are processed and published quarterly. To date the majority of Virginia’s localities building footprints have been captured but not all.</abstract>
