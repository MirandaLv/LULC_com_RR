  <abstract>The VA_COUNTY dataset is a feature class component of the Virginia Administrative Boundaries dataset from the Virginia Geographic Information Network (VGIN). VA_COUNTY represents the best available city and county boundary information to VGIN.
VGIN initially sought to develop an improved locality and town boundary dataset in late 2013, spurred by response of the Virginia Administrative Boundaries Workgroup community. The feature class initially started from the locality boundaries from the Census TIGER dataset for Virginia. VGIN solicited input from localities in Virginia through the Road Centerlines data submission process as well as through public forums such as the Virginia Administrative Boundaries Workgroup and VGIN listservs. Data received were analyzed and incorporated into the VA_COUNTY feature class where locality data were a superior representation of the city or county boundary.

VA_COUNTY is a feature class representing locality (county and city) boundaries in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This dataset was derived from Census TIGER data supplemented with data made available from the cities and counties themselves.
